# `Apache PIG`

## `Installation`

1.	Download the new release of Apache Pig from the below [link](https://downloads.apache.org/pig/pig-0.17.0/). In my case I have downloaded the pig-0.17.0.tar.gz version of Pig which is latest and about 220MB in size. 

2.	Now we extract this tar file with the help of below command (make sure to check your tar filename).
```sh
tar -xvf pig-0.17.0.tar.gz
```

3.	Create and open a new bash.sh file inside the directory.
```sh
gedit bash.sh
```

4.	We configure file, copy the below command inside this file and save it.
```text
export PIG_INSTALL=$(pwd) 
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
```

5.	Execute the bash.sh File using following command 
```sh
source bash.sh
```

6.	You can check your pig version with the below command.
```sh
